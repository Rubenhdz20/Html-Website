    <h1>Atomic Habits⏰</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>No matter your goals, Atomic Habits This book in English offers a proven framework for improvement ... every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts in habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break the bad guys and master the little behaviors that lead to remarkable results.</p>
        
        <p>If you have trouble changing your habits, the problem is not you. The problem is your system. Bad habits are repeated over and over not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You are not up to your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you will get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p>
        
        <p>Clear is known for its ability to distill complex themes into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, it is based on the most proven ideas in biology, psychology and neuroscience to create an easy to understand guide to make good habits inevitable and bad impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, Lifelong-saving doctors and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their trade and reach the top of their field.</p>
