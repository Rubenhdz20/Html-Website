    <h1>Sapiens🐒</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>From a renowned historian comes an innovative narrative of the creation and evolution of humanity - an international best-seller # 1 - which explores the ways in which biology and history have defined and improved our understanding of what it means to be "human". "A hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. However, today there is only one homo sapiens. ¿What happened to the others? ¿And what can happen to us?</p>
        
        <p>Most books on human history pursue a historical or biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the emergence of modern cognition. From examining the role that evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of broader ideas.</p>
       
        <p>Dr. Harari also forces us to look forward, Because in recent decades humans have begun to bend the laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. ¿Where does this lead us, and what do we want to become? With 27 photos, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations / diagrams, this provocative and insightful work will surely spark the debate and is an essential read for Jared Diamond fans James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright and Sharon Moalem.</p>
